fatal error: 'bits/stdc++.h' file not found

Try creating the bits directory simply at this location:
/usr/local/include/
(usr is in MACINTOSH HD location)
The final location of the header should be: /usr/local/include/bits/stdc++.h

Also I recommend you MacVim for coding, it's way better than Xcode or Vscode for competitive programming. Xcode just takes a lot of space and for each cpp file it requieres a Project in order to compile, that's not comfortable (Months ago I also used to use Xcode).
